# üé¨ RAG-Based Question Answering System Using MongoDB Movies Dataset  

This project is an intelligent system designed to answer user queries about movies by leveraging a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture. It involves migrating data from a NoSQL database (MongoDB) to a structured SQL database and then using that data to build a prompt-based QA system.

## üöÄ Key Takeaways  

- **Data Engineering:** Perform MongoDB ‚Üí SQL data migration using Python, design a relational schema, and preprocess data for a structured format.  
- **RAG Architecture:** Understand and implement a RAG architecture using the LangChain framework.  
- **LLM Integration:** Integrate a Large Language Model (LLM) like OpenAI‚Äôs GPT with structured data for intelligent response generation.  
- **Vector Search:** Create and utilize a vector store (FAISS) for efficient semantic search.

## üìù Problem Statement  
Design and develop a system that can answer user queries based on the `sample_mflix` movie dataset.  
The system‚Äôs core functionality relies on a **RAG architecture** that uses structured data from a SQL database, populated by migrating data from MongoDB.

## üí° Business Use Cases  

- AI chat assistant for movie recommendation platforms.  
- Intelligent FAQ system for cinemas or streaming services.  
- Semantic search for media metadata and user feedback.  
- Generate insights from user reviews and ratings.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Approach & Technical Stack  

The project is divided into two main phases: **Data Engineering (Phase 1)** and **RAG System Development (Phase 2).**

### Phase 1 ‚Äì Data Migration & Preprocessing  
- **Extract:** Python scripts connect to and extract data from the `sample_mflix` dataset in MongoDB.  
- **Transform:** Nested documents are flattened and collections are normalized to fit a relational schema.  
- **Load:** The transformed data is pushed into a PostgreSQL database.  

### Phase 2 ‚Äì RAG System  
- **Embedding:** Combine relevant fields (movie plots, reviews) and vectorize them using OpenAI embeddings.  
- **Vector Store:** Store the generated embeddings in a **FAISS** vector store for fast similarity search.  
- **RAG Logic:** Implement retrieval logic with **LangChain**, fetching relevant text chunks from the vector store based on a user‚Äôs query.  
- **Response Generation:** Use an LLM (OpenAI GPT-3.5) to generate accurate, context-aware, and intelligent responses.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used  

- **Databases:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL  
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** LangChain, OpenAI, FAISS, Streamlit, Pandas, psycopg2, SQLAlchemy, PyMongo, python-dotenv
